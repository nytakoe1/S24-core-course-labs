## GitHub Actions Workflow

###üöÄ Job: build
- **Runs on:** `ubuntu-latest`
- **Steps:**
  1. **Checkout code:** Fetches the latest code from the repository.
  2. **Cache dependencies:** Caches Python dependencies to improve build times.
  3. **Set up Python:** Configures the Python environment using actions/setup-python.
  4. **Install dependencies:** Upgrades pip and installs project dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  5. **Lint code with Flake8:** Uses Flake8 for linting Python code, ensuring adherence to coding standards.
  6. **Run tests:** Executes unit tests from `tests.py` to verify code functionality.
  7. **Snyk Checks:** Integrates Snyk for vulnerability scanning, ensuring dependencies are secure.
  8. **Docker Login:** Authenticates with Docker Hub using Docker Login action.
  9. **Build and Push Docker Image:** Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.

###üëçüèª Best Practices
- **Dependency Caching:** Utilizes GitHub Actions caching to speed up builds by caching Python dependencies.
- **Python Versioning:** Explicitly sets the Python version to 3.11 for consistency.
- **Pip Upgrade:** Upgrades pip to the latest version before installing dependencies.
- **Flake8 Linting:** Incorporates Flake8 for linting to enforce consistent coding standards.
- **Unit Testing:** Implements unit tests to ensure code correctness.
- **Snyk Integration:** Integrates Snyk for continuous vulnerability scanning of project dependencies.
- **Docker Build and Push:** Builds the Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub, enhancing containerization.

###‚ö°Ô∏è Conclusion
The CI workflow adheres to best practices, ensuring code quality, security, and efficient development processes.
